    <p id="projectDesc">I have improved my web designing skills since the start of this class. 
        I learned many new things throughout the Units and material I have 
        being taught. See how I started from Unit 1 and where I am at now (this website).
        I still have a lot to learn but to me it's impressive how much you can 
        learn in a limited amount of time.

        <p id="picDesc"> This is the first lab assignment I was assigned. 
            Very simplre and easy compared this website or the lab next to it.
            I started this class without having a clue of how any of this stuff 
            was done, however, with time and practice I learned how and now I 
            slowly develop my skills more and more as I go.

            This lab or project was the last one I did for this Webpage Development 
            class before completing this website. I managed to improve a lot from Unit 1. 
            I was able to change the background color, change various colors of the screen. 
            I even added a Youtube Video on there! I never thought I would never have thought 
            I would be able to build my own website but here it is!
