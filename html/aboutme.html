        <p id="picDesc"> In my free time I like to play soccer with my siblings or friends.
            I played soccer in High School and became one of the captains in varsity.
            It soon became my favorite sports and grew a strong passion for it.
            Mnay friehdships started because of this sport and I was able to coach 
            younger kids soccer for a couple of months for 4-H.
