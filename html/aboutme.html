        <p id="picDesc"> In my free time I like to play soccer with my siblings or friends.
            I played soccer in High School and became one of the captains in varsity.
            It soon became my favorite sports and grew a strong passion for it.
            Mnay friehdships started because of this sport and I was able to coach 
            younger kids soccer for a couple of months for 4-H.

            Painting, Drawing, or anything that has to do with being creative 
            and involves art I love doing it in my free tiem as well. I've always
             had a passion for art since I was young. If there is a paper and a 
             pencil in front of me I will for sure start sketchnig something. 
             However, that does not mean I'm good at it, I get told that I'm good 
             at being creative and when it comes to making a poster or designing 
             something the role is always given to me.

            I was born in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico and grew up there until I was 10 years old. 
            I moved to Ottumwa, Iowa with my mom and sister in 2015 and have lived here since then.
            During the holidays, my family and I travel to Oaxaca, Mexico, which is where my family is 
            from and where most of my family in Mexico is located at. I went to Ottumwa High School and 
            graduated from there in May 2024, and now I'm currently studying Computer Software Development
            at Indian Hills Community College pursuing my A.A.S.
